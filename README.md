# Unsupervised Structured Reporting via Cycle Consistency
Unsupervised Structured Report Generation using Cycle Consistency
## Project Abstract
Structured  reporting  is  an  important  toolin  radiology, as it can  provideconcise,  standardized and  complete reports.However, the development of automated systems to generate these reports is hindered by the scarcity of datasets comprising paired radiological images and corresponding structured reports. This project proposes anovel approach to circumvent the need for such paired data by harnessing unsupervised learning techniques, specifically  Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial  Networks  (CycleGANs)or  similar  frameworks,  for  the  generation  of coherent and contextually accurate radiological reports from unpaired data.
## Background and Motivation
Automatic   report   generation   in   radiologycanreduce   radiologistsâ€™workload   and   improve diagnostic performance[1,2]. While  there  is  a  lot  of  on-going  research  on free-text  radiology  report  generation,  the research on structured reports is very limited[3,4,5].However, structured reports have a lot of advantages in comparison  to  free-text  reports. Free-text  radiology  reports  present  findings  in  narrative  form,  which  can  be ambiguous and inconsistent. Structured reports use a standardized format with predefined categories, ensuring clearer and more organized information. For instance, while a free-text report may describe a lung nodule in a sentence,  a  structured  report  separates  details  into  specific  fields,  like  size,  location,  and  characteristics, reducing ambiguity and enhancing report quality.However, datasets comprising paired radiological images and corresponding   structured   reportsare   very   limited[5].Therefore   data-efficient   methods   for   generating structured radiology reports are of high interest.In  this  project,  we  aim  to  explore  the  use  of  cycle-consistency  based  generation  in  order  to  learn  structured report generation in an unsupervised manner. For this, the first step is to synthesize realistic structured reports via predefined rules capturing the essence of authentic radiological observations, creating a substantial corpus of unpaired synthetic reports. Leveraging the capabilities of CycleGANsor similar  models, a model capable of learning domain translations from radiological images to structured textcan be trained, employing the concept of cycle consistency to retain key diagnostic information.
